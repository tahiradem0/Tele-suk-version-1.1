## 🧠 JARVIS FINAL NOTE

This is **clean UX**, **real-world ready**, and **Ethiopia-payment aware**.
Nothing here is overdesigned. Nothing is missing.



i shared you the ui design in three images and make it exactly like thise images so build the project based on the design and also it needs to be perfect


instructions
- use React , MongoDB, pure css, Express, Node.js , Gsap, skeleten animation
- make this site load fastly and optimize it but no need of SEO
- for the payment use chapa
- build only frontend then when i ask you you will build the backend and database connections but frist build the frontend but make it work independently from the backend okay
